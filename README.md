# 🌐 Single Page Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! 🎯  
This project was built as part of the **IBM course on Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and serves as a professional snapshot of my skills, projects, and background.

## 📋 About

This is a **responsive single-page website** designed to showcase:

- 🧑‍💼 A short bio/About Me section  
- 💻 Skills and technologies I'm familiar with  
- 🧠 Projects I’ve worked on  
- 📫 Contact form to get in touch with me  

It's simple, clean, and straight to the point — just how a portfolio should be.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For structure  
- **CSS3** – For styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – For interactivity

## 🚀 Features

- Responsive design (mobile/tablet friendly)  
- Smooth scrolling navigation
